BitBin - Pastebin Knockoff Documentation

Overview
BitBin is a simple web application for sharing code snippets or text using unique slugs (short links). Users can paste code, highlight it, generate a shareable slug, and retrieve code by entering a slug. The application supports both dark and light (white) themes.

File Structure
index.html: Main frontend page with UI, code highlighting, and all main JavaScript logic.
DB_Connection.php: Backend PHP script for saving and retrieving code snippets from the database.
schema.sql: SQL schema for the required MySQL tables.
whitemode.js: Handles theme switching (dark/light mode).

How It Works
1. User Interface (index.html)
Paste Code: Users enter code in a textarea.
Highlight: Clicking "Show with highlighting" highlights the code using Highlight.js.
Share: Clicking "Share" generates a random slug, saves the code to the backend, and displays the slug.
Copy: Buttons allow copying the highlighted code or slug.
Retrieve: Users can enter a slug to retrieve and display the associated code.
Theme Switch: Toggle between dark and light mode.

2. Backend (DB_Connection.php)
Save Code: Receives POST requests with slug and text, saves or updates the code in the database.
Retrieve Code: Receives POST requests with get_slug, fetches the code for the given slug.
Database: Uses two tables:
random_links: Stores unique slugs.
html_texts: Stores code/text associated with each slug.

3. Database Schema (schema.sql)
random_links(id, slug)
html_texts(id, random_links_id, html_text)
Theme Switching (whitemode.js)
Stores the theme preference in localStorage.
Adds/removes the .whitemode class on the <body> to switch CSS variables.
Notes

All code and data are handled via AJAX/fetch requests; no page reloads are needed.
Highlight.js is used for syntax highlighting.
Example Usage
Paste code in the textarea.
Click "Show with highlighting" to preview.
Click "Share" to generate a slug and save the code.
Share the slug with others.
Anyone can retrieve the code by entering the slug and clicking "Retrieve Code".
